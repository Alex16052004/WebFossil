              Tyrannosaurus (/tɪˌrænəˈsɔːrəs, taɪ-/)[a] is a genus of large
              theropod dinosaur. The type species Tyrannosaurus rex (rex meaning
              'king' in Latin), often shortened to T. rex or colloquially T-Rex,
              is one of the best represented theropods. It lived throughout what
              is now western North America, on what was then an island continent
              known as Laramidia. Tyrannosaurus had a much wider range than
              other tyrannosaurids. Fossils are found in a variety of geological
              formations dating to the latest Campanian-Maastrichtian ages of
              the late Cretaceous period, 72.7 to 66 million years ago.

              million years ago. Two species are currently recognized, although
              others have been assigned in the past. The type species is V.
              mongoliensis, named and described in 1924. Fossils of this species
              have been discovered in the Djadochta Formation, Mongolia. A
              second species, V. osmolskae, was named in 2008 for skull material
              from the Bayan Mandahu Formation, China. Today, Velociraptor is

              that lived in North America during the Late Jurassic, about 155 to
              143 million years ago. It was first described by American
              paleontologist Elmer S. Riggs in 1903 from fossils found in the
              Colorado River valley in western Colorado, United States. Riggs
              named the dinosaur Brachiosaurus altithorax; the generic name is
              Greek for "arm lizard", in reference to its proportionately long
              arms, and the specific name means "deep chest". Brachiosaurus is
              estimated to have been between 18 and 22 meters (59 and 72 ft)
              long.

                  Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles[note 1] of the clade
                  Dinosauria. They first appeared during the Triassic period,
                  between 243 and 233.23 million years ago (mya), although the
                  exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is a
                  subject of active research. They became the dominant
                  terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction
                  event 201.3 mya and their dominance continued throughout the
                  Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. The fossil record shows that
                  birds are feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier
                  theropods during the Late Jurassic epoch, and are the only
                  dinosaur lineage known to have survived the
                  Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event approximately 66 mya.
                  Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into avian
                  dinosaurs—birds—and the extinct non-avian dinosaurs, which are
                  all dinosaurs other than birds. Dinosaurs are varied from
                  taxonomic, morphological and ecological standpoints. Birds, at
                  over 11,000 living species, are among the most diverse groups
                  of vertebrates. Using fossil evidence, paleontologists have
                  identified over 900 distinct genera and more than 1,000
                  different species of non-avian dinosaurs. Dinosaurs are
                  represented on every continent by both extant species (birds)
                  and fossil remains. Through most of the 20th century, before
                  birds were recognized as dinosaurs, most of the scientific
                  community believed dinosaurs to have been sluggish and
                  cold-blooded. Most research conducted since the 1970s,
                  however, has indicated that dinosaurs were active animals with
                  elevated metabolisms and numerous adaptations for social
                  interaction.

                <p class="card-text">
                  Dinosaurs belong to a group known as archosaurs, which also
                  includes modern crocodilians. Within the archosaur group,
                  dinosaurs are differentiated most noticeably by their gait.
                  Dinosaur legs extend directly beneath the body, whereas the
                  legs of lizards and crocodilians sprawl out to either
                  side.[26] Collectively, dinosaurs as a clade are divided into
                  two primary branches, Saurischia and Ornithischia. Saurischia
                  includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with
                  birds than with Ornithischia, while Ornithischia includes all
                  taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with Triceratops
                  than with Saurischia. Anatomically, these two groups can be
                  distinguished most noticeably by their pelvic structure. Early
                  saurischians—"lizard-hipped", from the Greek sauros (σαῦρος)
                  meaning "lizard" and ischion (ἰσχίον) meaning "hip
                  joint"—retained the hip structure of their ancestors, with a
                  pubis bone directed cranially, or forward.[33] This basic form
                  was modified by rotating the pubis backward to varying degrees
                  in several groups (Herrerasaurus,[130] therizinosauroids,[131]
                  dromaeosaurids,[132] and birds[11]). Saurischia includes the
                  theropods (exclusively bipedal and with a wide variety of
                  diets) and sauropodomorphs (long-necked herbivores which
                  include advanced, quadrupedal groups).[25][133] By contrast,
                  ornithischians—"bird-hipped", from the Greek ornitheios
                  (ὀρνίθειος) meaning "of a bird" and ischion (ἰσχίον) meaning
                  "hip joint"—had a pelvis that superficially resembled a bird's
                  pelvis: the pubic bone was oriented caudally (rear-pointing).
